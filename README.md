A solution to Project Euler's problem 54.

https://projecteuler.net/problem=54

*SPOILER ALERT*

The answer is 376 for the included test input file.

Uses Python 2.7 due to main dependency which is the Deuces library that does
the poker hand comparison.

Create a virtualenv (remember, Python 2.7!) and install requirements.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run main using:

`python poker_hands.py`

Or tests with:

`pytest tests.py`
